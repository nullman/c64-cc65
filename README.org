* cc65 Programs for the C64

  See the "Build and Run" sections of [[file:c64-cc65.org][c64-cc65.org]] to
  see how to build, clean, and run these applications using the VICE emulator.
  In general you follow these steps:

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run with =x64sc NAME.prg=.

  All files are generated from [[file:c64-cc65.org][c64-cc65.org]] using
  Emacs' org-mode literate programming system to "tangle" them.

  The example code at [[https://8bitworkshop.com/][8bitworkshop]] was
  instrumental in creating these programs.
